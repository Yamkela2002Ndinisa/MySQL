What is SQL?
SQL is the most common language for extracting and organising data that is stored in a relational database. A database is a table that consists of rows and columns. SQL is the language of databases. It facilitates retrieving specific information from databases that are further used for analysis. Even when the analysis is being done on another platform like Python or R, SQL would be needed to extract the data that you need from a company’s database.

WHAT IS SQL USED FOR?
erstand what is SQL and how does it work, let’s try to see what SQL can do. This programming language has various uses for data analysts & data science professionals. It is particularly helpful because it can:

Execute queries against a database
Retrieve data from a database
Insert records into a database
Update records in a database
Delete records from a database
Create new databases, or new tables in a database
Create stored procedures & views in a database
Set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
Imagine how difficult life would be if we did not have a way to control the database in this format. After getting a sense of what SQL is used for, let’s try our hands at learning SQL on an actual database.

INTRODUCTION TO DATABASE
A database is a collection of data that is specifically organized for rapid search and retrieval processed by a computer.
The difference between a database and a usual file is that a file may be structured or not, but a database must have a specific structure. For example, you can create a file with a to-do list
Database Management System
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a type of software that allows users to define, create, and control data.
A DBMS can optimize queries and retrieve data from а database in an optimal way. It is a mediator between the user and the database, which means that users can work with it through the interface of a DBMS. In addition, it can also help isolate data from the users.

INTRO TO MySQL

SQL is a querying language and MySQL is a database management service. SQL is a language used to operate with records. MySQL is a system that allows storing data in an organized database. So, the MySQL provides your interaction with information using the SQL query language.
For example, there are many other RDBMS besides MySQL: Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and others. All of them use SQL as query language.

ADVANTAGES TO MYSQL

Security. Data security in MySQL is an amazing benefit. Especially for applications where some confidential data or money transfers are processed. For example, in eCommerce, banking, and government websites.

Scalability. MySQL provides great scalability that allows building high-load systems without taking many places on servers. This solution allows a complete customization database with unique project requirements.

Performance. Thanks to its high performance, MySQL can process lots of queries quickly. So you can build high-load systems without having to worry about performance.
Workflow control. You can manage all the features based on the needs of your project. MySQL is also cross-platform, so it can efficiently work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Security. Data security in MySQL is an amazing benefit. Especially for applications where some confidential data or money transfers are processed. For example, in eCommerce, banking, and government websites.

DISADVANTAGES OF MYSQL
Big amounts of data. MySQL is not very efficient in handling very large databases.
Hard to debug. MySQL doesn't have as good a developing and debugging tool as compared to the paid database management systems.
