What is SQL?
SQL is the most common language for extracting and organising data that is stored in a relational database. A database is a table that consists of rows and columns. SQL is the language of databases. It facilitates retrieving specific information from databases that are further used for analysis. Even when the analysis is being done on another platform like Python or R, SQL would be needed to extract the data that you need from a company’s database.

WHAT IS SQL USED FOR?
erstand what is SQL and how does it work, let’s try to see what SQL can do. This programming language has various uses for data analysts & data science professionals. It is particularly helpful because it can:

Execute queries against a database
Retrieve data from a database
Insert records into a database
Update records in a database
Delete records from a database
Create new databases, or new tables in a database
Create stored procedures & views in a database
Set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
Imagine how difficult life would be if we did not have a way to control the database in this format. After getting a sense of what SQL is used for, let’s try our hands at learning SQL on an actual database.
